Bugs:



Products:


- WHEN WE ADD A NEW PRODUCT CATEGORY WE HAVE TO GENERATE
  PRIMARY KEY NAME IN FOLLOWING FORMAT: '3 letter name'_Part_Number
  PART NUMBERS ARE USED AS PRIMARY KEYS AND WE HARD CODE THE
  '_Part_Number' PART IN THE SQL QUERY ----SEE 'getProductDetails' ----

    Product Builder:

    Requirements:

    - Add new product category (table) to db
        * Add category abbreviation that will also be name of new table (Must be 3 letters long)
        * Should be able to add a variable number of attributes along with a choice of data type (String or Int)

    - Remove product category (table) from db
        * Drops entire product category including all data in table

    - Edit product category (table) from db
        * Category name
        * Category Attributes
        * Category Attribute data type

    - View existing categories in table
